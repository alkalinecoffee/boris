# Boris

**Boris is a networked-device scanning solution** that facilitates the communication between you and various networked devices over SNMP, SSH and WMI, pulling a large amount of configuration items including installed software, network settings, serial numbers, user accounts, disk utilization, and more.

Out of the box, Boris has server support for Windows, Red Hat, and Solaris (with other platforms available with future plugins!), with a focus on returning precisely formatted data, no matter which platforms your organization may employ.  Through the use of profiles, Boris can easily be extended by the developer to include other platforms.  A must have for anyone standing up or wishing to extend a configuration management system with the power of Ruby!
